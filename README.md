# NATURAL LANGUAGE NEURAL NETWORK MODEL

It is well documented that mental health problems are becoming increasignly more prevelant amongst children and young adults. This increase coencides with the growth of social media and shift towards a more virual form of communication, often making it hard for parents and peers to identify mental health troubles early and seek the help a child may need. Using modern technology, we can begin to identify and detect early signs of depression and anxiety and seek to provide help at an early stage.

This notebooks aims to assess the potential benefits of using Neural Networks to detect potentially alarming messages online. Given an extensive sample of messages (both alarming and not), I compare the accuracy of a traditional model (Naive Bayes) to a Deep Learning model when classifying messages. We see a significant improvement in accuracy.
