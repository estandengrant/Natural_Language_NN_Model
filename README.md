# NATURAL LANGUAGE NEURAL NETWORK MODEL

The growing prevalence of mental health issues amongst children and young adults has been linked to the rise of social media and the shift towards virtual communication. This evolution complicates early detection of mental health concerns, making it challenging for parents and peers to recognise problems and intervene promptly. Leveraging modern technology offers a pathway to identify early indicators of depression and anxiety, enabling timely assistance.

This notebook evaluates the use of Neural Networks for detecting concerning messages online. By analysing a comprehensive dataset of messages (both concerning and non-concerning), it contrasts the performance of a traditional Naive Bayes model with that of a Deep Learning model in message classification. The results demonstrate a notable enhancement in accuracy with the Deep Learning approach.
